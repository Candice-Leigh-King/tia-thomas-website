      <h1>Hello, I'm Tia, and I'm excited to welcome you to this blog.</h1><p>If
      you're a fellow travel enthusiast planning your next adventure, you've
      come to the right place. My ultimate life goal is to explore every country
      on Earth, with Montenegro, Guatemala, and Egypt ranking among my favorite
      destinations, and Pakistan, Argentina, and Kazakhstan on my travel bucket
      list. My journey has been marked by unforgettable adventures, from volcano
      boarding in Nicaragua to exploring Egyptian pyramids and hiking Machu
      Picchu. But it hasn't all been smooth sailing; I've faced challenges like
      being stranded at a border and having my cards blocked in a foreign land.
      These experiences inspired me to create this blog to share insights and
      help you navigate your travels more smoothly.</p><p>My passion for travel
      began early, and in 2018, I embarked on my first solo backpacking
      adventure through Southeast Asia. It kindled my love for budget travel,
      which became a defining feature of my explorations. While battling a
      health scare, I embarked on a journey to Zambia for a raw adventure.
      There, I received a life-altering diagnosis of Crohn's Disease. This
      revelation reshaped my travel plans and my perspective on
      life.</p><p>Despite setbacks, I continued to explore Europe while focusing
      on managing my health. The advent of COVID-19 reminded me of the fleeting
      nature of travel privileges. I took the opportunity to plan a dream
      journey through Central and South America, which I undertook with my
      partner, Ben. After returning, I created TeeTravels on Instagram to
      connect with fellow travel enthusiasts. Eventually, I took the bold step
      of leaving my job to travel full-time, embarking on a journey across
      Europe and Canada, with a working visa adventure.</p><p>As we look ahead,
      2024 promises exciting destinations, including Qatar, Pakistan, Australia,
      Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. Follow my
      Instagram to stay updated on my daily adventures.</p>
