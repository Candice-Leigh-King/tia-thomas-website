      <p class="center">Hello, I'm Tia, and I'm thrilled to have you on this
      blog. If you share my passion for travel and are planning your next
      adventure, you're in the right place. My ultimate goal is to explore every
      country on Earth, with favorites like Montenegro, Guatemala, and Egypt and
      dream destinations including Pakistan, Argentina, and Kazakhstan. I've had
      unforgettable adventures, like volcano boarding in Nicaragua and hiking
      Machu Picchu, but also encountered challenges such as being stranded at
      borders and dealing with blocked cards. These experiences inspired me to
      create this blog to share insights for smoother travel.</p><p
      class="center">My journey started with a solo backpacking trip through
      Southeast Asia in 2018, igniting my love for budget travel. Despite a
      health scare in Zambia that led to a Crohn's Disease diagnosis, I remained
      passionate about exploration. After managing my health in Europe, the
      COVID-19 pandemic served as a reminder of travel's fleeting nature. I
      seized the opportunity to travel Central and South America with my
      partner, Ben, and returned to establish TeeTravels on Instagram.
      Eventually, I left my job to pursue full-time travel through Europe and
      Canada with a working visa adventure.</p><p class="center">Looking ahead
      to 2024, my adventures will take me to Qatar, Pakistan, Australia, Japan,
      South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. Follow my Instagram
      for daily updates on my explorations.</p><p class="center"><a
