        Hello, I'm Tia, and I'm thrilled to have you on this blog. If you share
        my passion for travel and are planning your next adventure, you're in
        the right place. My ultimate goal is to explore every country on Earth,
        with favorites like Montenegro, Guatemala, and Egypt and dream
        destinations including Pakistan, Argentina, and Kazakhstan. I've had
        unforgettable adventures, like volcano boarding in Nicaragua and hiking
        Machu Picchu, but also encountered challenges such as being stranded at
        borders and dealing with blocked cards. These experiences inspired me to
        create this blog to share insights for smoother travel.


        My journey started with a solo backpacking trip through Southeast Asia
        in 2018, igniting my love for budget travel. Despite a health scare in
        Zambia that led to a Crohn's Disease diagnosis, I remained passionate
        about exploration. After managing my health in Europe, the COVID-19
        pandemic served as a reminder of travel's fleeting nature. I seized the
        opportunity to travel Central and South America with my partner, Ben,
        and returned to establish TeeTravels on Instagram. Eventually, I left my
        job to pursue full-time travel through Europe and Canada with a working
        visa adventure.


        Looking ahead to 2024, my adventures will take me to Qatar, Pakistan,
        Australia, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand.
        Follow my Instagram for daily updates on my explorations.
